Components can be nested

ng generate component componentName - Generates a new component, creating the folder, .html,.css,.ts and the component entry in app.module
Each component should have the folders name equals to his name
Each component has his own Decorator specifying the selector, template Url and style

The tamplate property can be filled with the relative component path(templateUrl) or in tags(template)
Template is a REQUIRED property

The styles property can be filled with the relative component path(stylesUrl) or in pure code(styles)
Template is a NOT REQUIRED property
You can combien both options of styles, however make sure to apply it as an array

You can define a selector as an attribute putting into [] 
and swapping the tag definition in the index.html do a html property with the selector name like : <div app-servers>
It is also recognized defining it as a class
